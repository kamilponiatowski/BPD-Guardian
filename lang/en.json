      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "desc": "Answers to common questions about splitting and using the application",
      "q1": "Is splitting always a symptom of BPD?",
      "a1": "No, splitting can also occur in people without a BPD diagnosis, especially in situations of severe stress or as a result of traumatic experiences. However, in people with BPD it occurs regularly and significantly affects their relationships.",
      "q2": "Does a person with BPD deliberately manipulate through splitting?",
      "a2": "No, splitting is not conscious manipulation. It's an automatic defense mechanism that a person with BPD uses unconsciously to protect themselves from anxiety and emotional pain. Understanding this is key to an empathetic approach.",
      "q3": "What are the most effective ways to deal with splitting?",
      "a3": "The most effective ways are: staying calm, validating your partner's feelings without confirming false accusations, avoiding a defensive attitude, clear but empathetic communication, and, when possible, therapy (individual for both parties or couples therapy). Working on your own emotional stability is also key.",
      "q4": "Can splitting be completely cured?",
      "a4": "In the case of BPD, splitting can be reduced through appropriate therapy (e.g., Dialectical Behavior Therapy - DBT), but it rarely disappears completely. However, a person can learn to better manage this mechanism and its impact on relationships.",
      "q5": "How to take care of yourself in a relationship with someone experiencing splitting?",
      "a5": "Set clear boundaries and stick to them. Find support (friends, family, therapist). Remember that you are not responsible for the other person's emotions. Practice stress management techniques. Take care of your needs and mental health.",
      "q6": "Does this app replace professional psychological help?",
      "a6": "No, this app is an educational and supportive tool, but it does not replace professional psychological help. If you are experiencing serious difficulties in your relationship, it is worth consulting a psychologist or psychotherapist."
